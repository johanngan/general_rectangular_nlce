# Site enumeration

Site enumeration is done left-to-right, bottom-to-top. E.g. a 3x3 lattice would have sites labels:

```
7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3
```

# Spin-1/2 states

Many-body spin-1/2 states are encoded by bit strings, where the 2^0 bit represents site 1, the 2^1 bit represents site 2, etc. Spin-up is encoded by 0, spin-down is encoded by 1.
